Badminton is a racket (or racquet) sport played between two teams of one or two people. Badminton can be played indoors or outdoors, and the objective is to use a racket to launch a small projectile, called a shuttlecock, over a raised net. In addition to a shuttlecock, the essential equipment you will need for badminton include rackets and a net.
